## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

Initial release of the SCANOSS Go CLI and SDK (`scanoss`).

### Added

- **`scan <path>`** — fingerprint a file or folder (WFP winnowing), upload to the SCANOSS v3 batch
  API in parallel chunks, and poll to completion; an interrupted scan resumes with
  `scanoss results <scan-id>`. `--format raw|spdx|cyclonedx` selects the output and
  `--include deps,vulns,licenses,crypto,geo` opts into extra layers, narrowed to what the chosen
  format can render (a layer it can't represent is skipped with an up-front notice).
  `scan wfp <file>` scans a pre-generated WFP.
- **`wfp <path>`** — generate WFP fingerprints only, without uploading.
- **`results <scan-id>`** — resume or poll a previous scan by its id.
- **`sbom <input>`** — offline: produce an SBOM from a scanoss raw inventory, or convert between
  CycloneDX 1.7 and SPDX 2.3 (input format detected from content). No API calls; best-effort (data
  a target can't represent — e.g. SPDX vulnerabilities — is dropped with a warning).
- **`enrich <input>`** — online: decorate an existing raw inventory, CycloneDX, or SPDX with the
  purl-keyed layers `vulns`/`licenses`/`crypto`/`geo`, with no source tree or re-scan (re-runnable
  to refresh). The output format defaults to the input's; `--format` converts in the same pass.
- **`dependencies [path]`** — parse local manifests, or query direct/transitive dependencies for a
  PURL.
- **`attributions [sbom]`** — attribution text from an SBOM file or a PURL.
- **Decoration commands** over the SCANOSS Services API v3: `vulnerabilities`, `licenses`,
  `cryptography`, `geoprovenance`, `copyright`, and `components`.
- **`raw` output** (default) — a neutral inventory in a versioned envelope (`schema_version` +
  `metadata` + `components` + `vulnerabilities`): detected and declared components in one
  `components` list tagged by `scope`, per-component layers (`licenses`, `cryptography`,
  `geoprovenance`) inline, and vulnerabilities as a flat top-level list. Each component records
  where it came from in `evidence` — scanned files that matched (`match_type` `file`/`snippet`) or
  the manifest that declared it (`match_type` `declared`). A bare scan (no `--include`) makes no
  decoration calls.
- **SBOM export** — SPDX 2.3 and CycloneDX 1.7, with the SCANOSS `url_hash` preserved (an SPDX
  `OTHER` external reference / a CycloneDX `scanoss:url_hash` property) and vulnerability detail
  (CVSS score/vector/method, CWE, EPSS).
- **Declared dependencies** (`--include deps`) are sourced directly from the project's manifests
  (`package.json`, `go.mod`, …) and decorated alongside the scan matches — no dependency-resolution
  round trip.
- **File filtering** — built-in defaults, `.gitignore`, and `scanoss.json` rules; client-side
  `bom.remove`.
- **Progress & status output** — live progress bars for every phase (fingerprint, upload, server,
  dependency parsing, each enrichment layer); status notices with icons and color (`⚠` warnings,
  `ℹ` info, `✓` success) on an interactive terminal (Windows 10+ included), disabled when
  piped/redirected or `NO_COLOR` is set; a `Results written to <path>` line for `--output`.
- **`-v, --verbose`** — structured `log/slog` debug output on stderr (the scan flow, each API
  request with method/URL/status/duration, fingerprinting, and decoration).
- **Go SDK** (`pkg/scanoss`) — scan and decoration services with a parallel decoration pipeline;
  `pkg/scanpipeline` assembles a neutral `sbom.Inventory`, and `pkg/sbom` reads and writes
  CycloneDX and SPDX (with `WithTool`/`WithAuthor`/`WithTimestamp` document-metadata options).
- **C shared library** (`libscanoss`) with Node.js and Python bindings.
