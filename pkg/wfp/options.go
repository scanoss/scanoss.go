type Option func(*options)

// options is zero-valued at the defaults, so a path that builds one without resolveOptions still
// fingerprints the way a caller passing no option would. That is why the filter is recorded as
// its opt-out, keepHeaders, rather than as skipHeaders.

// file from its fingerprint, so two files sharing nothing but a common licence block do not look
// alike to the matcher.
//
// The filter is on by default; this option is how a caller caps it, and how it turns the filter
// back on after WithoutSkipHeaders — the last of the two wins. limit caps how many leading lines
// may be dropped; 0 or less means no cap.
