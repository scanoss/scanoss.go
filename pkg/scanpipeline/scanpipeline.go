// Package scanpipeline runs the scan pipeline that assembles a neutral sbom.Inventory. Run is
// the full flow over a source path: collect files → fingerprint → scan → source declared
// dependencies from the same files → gather + enrich the requested layers via the SDK's
// decoration pipeline (scanoss.DecorationPipeline). Enricher is the gathering half on its own,
// for callers that already have an inventory (a scan result, or a parsed SBOM). Rendering
// is left to sbom.Generate — this package does not render. Layers to gather are driven by the
// caller's request, never by any output format.
