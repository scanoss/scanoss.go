// but the third has only ever been seen arriving in the envelope that already reports the scan
// completed, never in one reporting it still scanning: it is too short to fall between two polls.
// Giving it a segment of its own left the last third of the bar unreachable, so the bar stopped at
// two thirds and jumped to done.

// What this reports is which pass is running, not how much work is left. The latter cannot be
// known: each pass's size is only discovered by running the one before it, and the passes work on
// shrinking subsets of the same files, so there is no total to count towards. A pass beyond the
