// Package logging is where this module's logging is wired: the sink every package
// reports through, and the handler the CLI installs into it.
//
// Nothing takes a logger as a parameter or holds one in a field. Most of this module is
// local computation — filtering, fingerprinting, parsing manifests, rendering SBOMs —
// with no client to hang a logger off, so a per-instance logger would reach a fraction
// of it. A single sink with a global setter covers all of it in one call.
// Logs go to stderr so stdout stays reserved for results/SBOM/JSON output.
